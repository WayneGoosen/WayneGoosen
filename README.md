# What Makes My GitHub Account Stand Out? 🧐

<h3>1. Architecture Design Records (ADR) <a href="https://adr.waynegoosen.com/log4brains/" target="_blank">Website</a> 📒</h3>

A website documenting any decisions around my projects on GitHub. It is crucial to know the context and tradeoffs behind a decision to understand it fully. View it [here](https://adr.waynegoosen.com/log4brains/)

<h3>2. Tech Radar <a href="https://techradar.waynegoosen.com/" target="_blank">Website</a> 💭</h3>

This tech radar is used to track and manage the technologies utilized in my personal GitHub projects. It helps in:

- Visualizing Progress: Providing a clear snapshot of the current state and evolution of the technologies in use.
- Guiding Decisions: Assisting in making informed decisions about which technologies to adopt, trial, or reassess.
- Documenting Journey: Keeping a record of the technological journey, showing what has been tried, what is being used, and what has been put on hold.

This tech radar ensures that I maintain a structured approach to technology adoption and usage, aligning with best practices and future goals for my personal projects. This originates from [Thoughtworks](https://www.thoughtworks.com/radar). View my Tech Radar [here](https://techradar.waynegoosen.com/)

<h3>3. What's the Damage (WTD)? 💰</h3>

It is always fascinating to know the cost of running an application, especially when using cloud services. There will be a WTD section within each repository README that highlights the expected or current cost of running the software.

<h3>4. Release Stage Badge 🚀</h3>

This describes the current stage the software is in. Possible values are: 
- Proof of Concept (PoC): An initial demonstration to verify that a concept or theory is feasible.
- Development: The stage where the actual product is built and initial features are implemented.
- Alpha: Early testing phase where the product is tested internally for functionality and major issues.
- Beta: Testing phase where the product is released to a limited audience for real-world exposure and feedback.
- Release Candidate (RC): A version that is potentially ready for final release, pending final testing and bug fixes.
- General Availability (GA): The product is officially released and available to all users.
- End of Life (EOL): The product is no longer supported or maintained, and users are advised to upgrade or switch to a newer version.

This can be found in the repository README.

<h3>5. Standardized README ✏️</h3>

When you come across any repository within my account, they are guaranteed to have these in the README:
- Badges under title: Release stage badge, Website up, license etc.
- Hosting and Deployment
- Architecture Overview
- What's the Damage (WTD)?
