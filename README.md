# What Makes My GitHub Account Stand Out? 🧐

## 1. Architecture Design Records (ADR) [Website](https://adr.waynegoosen.com/log4brains/) 📒

A website documenting any decisions around my projects on GitHub. It is crucial to know the context and tradeoffs behind a decision to understand it fully. [Read my ADRs](https://adr.waynegoosen.com/log4brains/)

## 2. Tech Radar [Website](https://techradar.waynegoosen.com/) 💭

This tech radar is used to track and manage the technologies utilized in my personal GitHub projects. It helps in:

- Visualizing Progress: Providing a clear snapshot of the current state and evolution of the technologies in use.
- Guiding Decisions: Assisting in making informed decisions about which technologies to adopt, trial, or reassess.
- Documenting Journey: Keeping a record of the technological journey, showing what has been tried, what is being used, and what has been put on hold.

This tech radar ensures that I maintain a structured approach to technology adoption and usage, aligning with best practices and future goals for my personal projects. This originates from [Thoughtworks](https://www.thoughtworks.com/radar). [View my technologies](https://techradar.waynegoosen.com/)

## 3. What's the Damage (WTD)? 💰

It is always fascinating to know the cost of running an application, especially when using cloud services. There will be a WTD section within each repository README that highlights the expected or current cost of running the software.

## 4. Release Stage Badge 🚀

This describes the current stage the software is in. Possible values are:

- Proof of Concept (PoC): An initial demonstration to verify that a concept or theory is feasible.
- Development: The stage where the actual product is built and initial features are implemented.
- Alpha: Early testing phase where the product is tested internally for functionality and major issues.
- Beta: Testing phase where the product is released to a limited audience for real-world exposure and feedback.
- Release Candidate (RC): A version that is potentially ready for final release, pending final testing and bug fixes.
- General Availability (GA): The product is officially released and available to all users.
- End of Life (EOL): The product is no longer supported or maintained, and users are advised to upgrade or switch to a newer version.

This can be found in the repository README.

## 5. Standardized README ✏️

When you come across any repository within my account, they are guaranteed to have these in the README:

- Badges under title: Release stage badge, Website up, license etc.
- Hosting and Deployment
- Architecture Overview
- What's the Damage (WTD)?
